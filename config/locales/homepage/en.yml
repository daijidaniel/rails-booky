      about_us_subtitle: Genesis of our place's name is the result of a combination of the term "glamour camping" and the founder's japanese last name. The synergy of the artistic soul, with the magical area and the idea of slow living, allowed to realize an unconventional vision of creating an unrivalled glamour camping, which is a mix of wild nature with a luxury hotel standards. Our location is a definite advantage - just 15 minutes from Warsaw is enough to forget about the rush of the city, enjoy nature and find inner peace.
